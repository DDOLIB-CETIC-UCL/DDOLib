/**
 * Defines the abstraction of a <b>cache mechanism</b> used to prune and reduce the
 * search space during the compilation or exploration of a Decision Diagram (DD).
 * <p>
 * The cache stores <em>thresholds</em> associated with subproblems encountered
 * during the search. These thresholds represent bounds (on value or feasibility)
 * that can be reused to avoid re-exploring equivalent or dominated states in
 * subsequent iterations or at different depths of the DD.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>By maintaining and comparing thresholds, the cache helps:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Prevent redundant computation on subproblems already explored with
 *       better or equivalent objective values.</li>
 *   <li>Accelerate convergence of relaxed DDs by reusing partial results.</li>
 *   <li>Reduce memory footprint by discarding obsolete layers.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>This interface defines the operations required for cache initialization,
 * lookup, update, and cleanup at various layers of the decision diagram.</p>
