 * The classes in this package compose the framework you will be using to

 * <p>
 * The framework is structured as follows:
 * <ul>
 *
 *  <li>
 *      The {@code core} package comprises all the necessary abstractions (interfaces,
 *      data types,...) that you will want to manipulate when solving a problem
 *      with BaB + MDD.
 *   </li>
