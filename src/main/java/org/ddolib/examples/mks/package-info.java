/**
 * The Multidimensional Knapsack Problem (MKP) is a generalization of the KP
 * to multiple capacity constraints: $n$ items and $m$ dimensions of the knapsack
 * are given, each dimension with capacity bound $(C_1,\ldots ,C_m)$.
 * An item $j$ occupies a weight dimension $w^i_j$  in the knapsack
 * for $i\in\{1,\ldots , m\}$ for a value of $v_j$.
 * The goal is to select a subset of items whose sum of profits is
 * maximized so that all the capacity bound constraints hold simultaneously.
