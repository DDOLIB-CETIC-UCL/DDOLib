/**
 * Relaxation operator for the Golomb Ruler (GR) problem.
 * <p>
 * This class defines how multiple search states ({@link GRState}) can be merged
 * to create a relaxed (i.e., aggregated) state during search algorithms such as
 * DDO (Decision Diagram Optimization) or Anytime Column Search.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The relaxation used here computes the intersection of the sets of marks and
 * distances present in the input states. This ensures that only marks and
 * distances common to all states are kept in the merged state.
 * The resulting state represents a conservative approximation that does not
 * introduce new distances, preserving feasibility.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The last mark in the merged state is the minimum of all last marks
 * across the input states, ensuring consistency with the most constrained (shortest) partial ruler.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p><b>Example:</b></p>
 * <pre>{@code
 * GRRelax relax = new GRRelax();
 * GRState merged = relax.mergeStates(List.of(state1, state2).iterator());
 * }</pre>
