/**
 * This package implements the acs, astar and ddo models for the Bounded Knapsack Problem (BKS).
 * A bounded knapsack problem is a variation of the classic knapsack problem
 * where each item can be included in the knapsack a limited number of times.
 * Given a knapsack having a maximum (weight) capacity,  a set of items {1, ... ,n} where all items of type i have
 * a profit value values_i, a weight weights_i and a quantity quantity_i of identical copies of this item.
 * The goal is to select quantities of each item i, such that the total weight of the selected items does not
 * exceed the knapsack capacity and the total profit is maximized.
