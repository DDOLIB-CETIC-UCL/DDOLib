/**
 * This package implements the acs, astar and ddo models for the Maximum Independent Set Problem (MISP).
 * Given a weighted graph 𝐺 = (𝑉,𝐸,𝑤) where 𝑉= {1,...,𝑛}
 * is a set of vertices, 𝐸 \subset 𝑉 ×𝑉 the set of edges connecting those vertices and
 * 𝑤 = {𝑤1,𝑤2,...,𝑤𝑛} is a set of weights s.t. 𝑤𝑖 is the weight of node 𝑖.
 * The problem consists in finding a subset of vertices in a graph such that
 * no edge exists in the graph that connects two of the selected nodes and
 * the sum of the weight of the selected nodes is maximal.
