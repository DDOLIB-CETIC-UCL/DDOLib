/**
 * ################  The Pigment Sequencing Problem (PSP)  ######################
 * The Pigment Sequencing Problem (PSP) is a single-machine production planning problem
 * that aims to minimize the stocking and changeover costs while satisfying a set of orders.
 * There are different item types I = {0,...,ùëõ‚àí1}.
 * For each type, a given stocking cost S_i to pay for each time period
 * between the production and the deadline of an order.
 * For each pair i,j in I of item types, a changeover cost C_ij is incurred
 * whenever the machine switches the production from item type i to j.
 * Finally, the demand matrix Q contains all the orders: Q_i^p in {0,1}
 * indicates whether there is an order for item type i in I at time period p.
 * 0 ‚â§ p &lt; H where H is the time horizon.
