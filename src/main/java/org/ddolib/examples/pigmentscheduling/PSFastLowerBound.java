/**
 * Computes a fast lower bound for the Pigment Sequencing Problem (PSP).
 * <p>
 * This class implements the {@link FastLowerBound} interface for {@link PSState}
 * and combines two complementary lower-bound estimations:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 *     <li>A <b>changeover cost lower bound</b> derived from a precomputed
 *         Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) lower bound on all subsets of items.</li>
 *     <li>A <b>stocking cost lower bound</b> computed using the Wagner-Whitin approach
 *         on the remaining items to produce.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * These estimations follow the principle presented in the
 * <a href="https://webperso.info.ucl.ac.be/~pschaus/assets/thesis/2024-coppe.pdf">
 * PhD Thesis of Vianney Coppe (2024)</a>, which states that since the two cost components
 * (changeover and stocking) do not overlap, their respective lower bounds can be summed
 * to produce a stronger Relaxed Lower Bound (RLB) for the PSP.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p><b>Key idea:</b> The changeover costs are bounded using a TSP-like structure,
 * while the stocking costs are bounded based on the minimal inventory holding
 * costs required to satisfy all pending demands.</p>
