/**
 * This package implements the acs, astar and ddo models for the Maximum 2-Satisfiability Problem (MAX2SAT) Problem.
 * Given a logic formula in CNF whose clauses (of the formula comprises at most two literals)
 * have each been assigned a weight, the MAX2SAT problem consists in finding a variable assignment
 * that maximizes the total weight of the satisfied clauses.
 * This problem is considered in the paper:
 *      - David Bergman et al. Decision Diagrams for Optimization. Ed. by Barry O’Sullivan and Michael Wooldridge. Springer, 2016.
 *      - David Bergman et al. “Discrete Optimization with Decision Diagrams”. In: INFORMS Journal on Computing 28.1 (2016), pp. 47–66.
