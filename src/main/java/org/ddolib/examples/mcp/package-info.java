/**
 * This package implements the acs, astar and ddo models for the Maximum Cut Problem (MCP).
 * Given an undirected weighted graph 𝐺 = (𝑉,𝐸) in which the weight of
 * the edge (𝑖,𝑗) ∈ 𝐸 is denoted 𝑤_{i,j} the MCP consists in finding a bi-partition (𝑆,𝑇)
 * of the vertices of some given graph that maximizes the total weight of edges whose endpoints are in different partitions.
 * This problem is considered in the papers:
