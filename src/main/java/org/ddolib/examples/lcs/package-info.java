 * ############### Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) ####################
 * In the Longest Common Subsequence Problem (LCS), we are given a set of 𝑚
 * input strings 𝑆= {𝑆0,...,𝑆𝑚−1 }composed of characters from a given alpha-
 * bet Σ. The goal is to find the longest subsequence appearing in all strings,
 * that can be obtained by removing some characters from each input string.
