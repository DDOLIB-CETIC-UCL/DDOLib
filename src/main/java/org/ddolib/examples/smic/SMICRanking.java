/**
 * The {@code SMICRanking} class defines a heuristic ranking criterion for
 * comparing two {@link SMICState} instances during search or optimization.
 * <p>
 * It implements the {@link StateRanking} interface, which is used by
 * decision diagram optimization (DDO) solvers or search algorithms to
 * determine the relative quality or priority of explored states.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * In this implementation, the ranking is based solely on the
 * {@code currentTime} attribute of the state â€” that is, the state
 * with the smaller current time is considered better (ranked higher),
 * since it represents a schedule that reaches an earlier point in time.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * This ranking can be used, for example, to expand partial schedules
 * that have progressed less in time before others, potentially leading
 * to better exploration efficiency in time-sensitive scheduling problems.
