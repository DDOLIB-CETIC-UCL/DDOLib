/**
 * The {@code SMICFastLowerBound} class provides a fast and simple estimation
 * of the lower bound of the remaining cost (or completion time) in the
 * Single Machine with Inventory Constraint (SMIC) scheduling problem.
 * <p>
 * This lower bound is computed based on the processing times and release dates
 * of the remaining jobs to be scheduled in a given state of the search process.
 * It is intended to provide a quick and computationally inexpensive
 * approximation to guide search algorithms such as DDO (Decision Diagram Optimization)
 * or ACS (Anytime Column Search).
 * </p>
 *
 * <p><b>Computation principle:</b></p>
 * <ul>
 *     <li>The method accumulates the total processing time of all remaining jobs.</li>
 *     <li>It also identifies the earliest release time among these jobs.</li>
 *     <li>The lower bound is then the sum of these processing times plus a correction
 *         based on the difference between the earliest release date and the current time.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 * The bound does not attempt to be exact but rather provides a quick estimation
 * to help pruning suboptimal branches in the search tree.
 * </p>
