/**
 * The {@code SMICRelax} class implements a relaxation operator for the
 * {@link SMICProblem}, used in Decision Diagram Optimization (DDO)-based solvers.
 * <p>
 * The relaxation defines how to merge multiple {@link SMICState} instances
 * representing similar subproblems into a single aggregated state, in order
 * to reduce the diagram size while maintaining an admissible relaxation
 * (i.e., not underestimating the true cost).
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * This specific relaxation merges states by:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Taking the <b>union</b> of their remaining jobs,</li>
 *   <li>Taking the <b>minimum</b> of their current times (earliest time reached),</li>
 *   <li>Taking the <b>maximum</b> of their minimum inventory levels,</li>
 *   <li>Taking the <b>minimum</b> of their maximum inventory levels.</li>
 * </ul>
 * If the resulting inventory interval becomes infeasible
 * (i.e., {@code minCurrentInventory > maxCurrentInventory}),
 * the merged state uses the same value for both bounds
 * to ensure consistency.
 *
 * <p>
 * The {@link #relaxEdge(SMICState, SMICState, SMICState, Decision, double)} method
 * does not alter the transition cost â€” it returns the same value as the original edge,
 * meaning this relaxation focuses on state aggregation only.
 * </p>
