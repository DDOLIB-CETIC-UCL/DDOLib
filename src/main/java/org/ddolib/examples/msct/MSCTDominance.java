/**
 * Implements the dominance relation for the Maximum Sum of Compatible Tasks (MSCT) problem.
 * <p>
 * This class defines how two states of the MSCT problem can be compared in terms of dominance.
 * In this context, a state {@code state1} is said to be <i>dominated or equal</i> to another
 * state {@code state2} if both states have the same set of remaining jobs to schedule,
 * and {@code state2} achieves the same or an earlier current time (i.e., a better schedule
 * in terms of completion time).
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The dominance relation is used in search algorithms (such as DDO or A*) to prune
 * suboptimal states â€” if one state dominates another, the dominated state can be safely
 * discarded without affecting optimality.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p><b>Example:</b></p>
 * <pre>
 * MSCTState s1 = new MSCTState(remainingJobs1, 10);
 * MSCTState s2 = new MSCTState(remainingJobs1, 8);
 *
 * MSCTDominance dominance = new MSCTDominance();
 * boolean result = dominance.isDominatedOrEqual(s1, s2); // true, since s2.currentTime() is less than s1.currentTime()
 * </pre>
