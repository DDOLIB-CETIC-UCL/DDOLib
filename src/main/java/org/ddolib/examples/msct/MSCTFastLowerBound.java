/**
 * Provides a fast lower bound computation for the Maximum Sum of Compatible Tasks (MSCT) problem.
 * <p>
 * The {@link MSCTFastLowerBound} class estimates a lower bound on the total completion time
 * (or cost) that can be achieved from a given partial state of the problem.
 * This lower bound is used within search-based optimization algorithms
 * (such as A*, ACS, or DDO) to prune suboptimal branches and guide the search toward
 * promising solutions.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The lower bound is computed based on the remaining tasks to be scheduled and the
 * current state of the system. It takes into account the earliest possible start time
 * (release date) and the smallest processing time among the remaining tasks.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p><b>Computation logic:</b></p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Let {@code k} be the number of remaining tasks to schedule.</li>
 *   <li>{@code minProcessing} is the smallest processing time among the remaining tasks.</li>
 *   <li>{@code minRelease} is the smallest release time among the remaining tasks.</li>
 *   <li>{@code u} is the maximum between {@code state.currentTime()} and {@code minRelease}.</li>
 * </ul>
 * The lower bound is then estimated as:
 * <pre>
 *     LB = k * u + minProcessing * (k * (k + 1) / 2.0)
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * This formula roughly estimates the minimal cumulative processing time that remains
 * given the current schedule state.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p><b>Example:</b></p>
 * <pre>
 * MSCTProblem problem = new MSCTProblem("data/MSCT/msct1.txt");
 * MSCTState state = new MSCTState(...);
 * MSCTFastLowerBound lb = new MSCTFastLowerBound(problem);
 *
 * double lowerBound = lb.fastLowerBound(state, Set.of(0, 1, 2));
 * System.out.println("Estimated lower bound: " + lowerBound);
 * </pre>
