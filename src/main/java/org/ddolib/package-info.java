/**
 * Main package of the framework. The structure is the following:
 *
 * <ul>
 *     <li>
 *          The {@code modeling} package contains interfaces and abstract classes to extend for
 *  *      implementing your optimization problem.
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *         The {@code factory} package provides a user-friendly api, e.g. factory for solvers with
 *  *      default values.
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *         The {@code common} package contains interfaces and class that can be used for all kind
 *         of solvers
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *         The {@code ddo} package composes the framework you will be using to complete your
 *         assignment on the Branch-and-Bound with MDD algorithm.
 *     </li>
 * </ul>
